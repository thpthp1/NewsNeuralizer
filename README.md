## Introduction
This serves as the README for the project "News Neuralizer" which was created for the Department of Computer and Data Sciences Senior Capstone at Case Western Reserve University. The goal of this project was to use artificial intelligence to accurately predict whether an article of news was real or fake. 

## Usage
The final product can be found [here](https://newsneuralizer.herokuapp.com/). Here users have the option to paste the link or to alternatively manually input the title and text body of a web article. The text is sent to a Natural Language Processing pipeline which was trained to recognize the difference between real and fake articles of news with up to 98% accuracy.

## Methods and Results
For a full discussion of the methods and results of this project, see ``FinalReport.pdf`` within the repository.

## Acknowledgements
The authors of this project would like to thank Case Western Reserve University for providing the resources and education to make this project a success.
