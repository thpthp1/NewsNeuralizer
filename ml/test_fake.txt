Yoko Ono: “I Had an Affair with Hillary Clinton in the ’70s” 

Los Angeles | Yoko Ono shocked reporters yesterday when she responded to a question concerning the presidential run of Hillary Clinton and the possibility that she could become the first woman President of the United States in American history.

The artist and widow of John Lennon, who is in Los Angeles to present a collection of cups and saucers she is exhibiting at the Museum of Modern Art, totally took reporters by surprise by admitting she had not only met the former First Lady at various times during a series of protests against the Vietnam War in New York in the 1970s but also knew her “intimately”.

The celebrity admitted laughingly to having “a fling” with her at the time and acknowledged her election “would be a great advancement for LGBT and Women rights in America” she added.

Yoko Ono when asked about her thoughts about Hillary’s run for the presidency completely took reporters by surprise.

    “We met many times during the New York Vietnam War protests in the 1970s and became very intimate,” she told reporters.

“We shared many of the same values about sexual equality, fighting against the authoritarian, patriarchal, male-dominated society we were raised in” she explained.

    “We had a brief romantic fling when I lived with John in Manhattan and Hillary was studying at Yale, but eventually we lost touch” she added.

“I am amazed how things are going well for her and wish her the best,” she said during the press conference.

Some conservative experts believe the statement could affect the presidential candidate’s bid for the 2020 presidency but previous allegations of Hillary Clinton’s lesbian past, which have resurfaced a number of times in the past two decades, have not seemed to have had a major impact in Hillary’s political career to date, admit others.
